# Crypto_clustering


The purpose of crypto analysis was to use machine learning tecqinques to create report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investment.

In order to create a usuable data for unspervised machine learning it needed to be cleaned by removing null values, un-needed coloumns were dropped, data types matched. The cleaning data were applied to the following unsupervised learning model techniques: 

a. StandardScaler

b. PCA algorithm to reduces the dimensions

c. K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters

d. hvPlot 

e. 3D plot

f. hvplot.table
